ex1
When a certain current load profile id over time is applied to the battery find the voltage v across the battery terminals under the following model assumptions. ( Ideal battery,R-int model,RC model,2RC model). (Assume that the OCV of the battery is constant)

hw2
Calculate OCV voltage & peak-power of a battery when OCV parameters are given according to the Combined model.

hw3
When a certain current load profile id over time is applied to the battery find the voltage v across the battery terminals under the following model assumptions. ( Ideal battery,R-int model,RC model,2RC model). (OCV of the battery is not remined constant while the battery is being discharged.)



means.mat
Measured voltage and current data. Voltage and current during charge and discharge at 25°C.


hw_part_b
The true SOC at time k can be recursively computed using the Coulomb counting equation:
A least square approach is used to estimate the simplest ECM parameters of a battery.
