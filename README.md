ex1
When a certain current load profile id over time is applied to the battery find the voltage v across the battery terminals under the following model assumptions. ( Ideal battery,R-int model,RC model,2RC model). (Assume that the OCV of the battery is constant)

hw2
Calculate OCV voltage & peak-power of a battery when OCV parameters are given according to the Combined model.

hw3
When a certain current load profile id over time is applied to the battery find the voltage v across the battery terminals under the following model assumptions. ( Ideal battery,R-int model,RC model,2RC model). (OCV of the battery is not remined constant while the battery is being discharged.)
